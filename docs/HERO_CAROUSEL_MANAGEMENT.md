  headline: string;
  highlightedText: string;
  subheadline: string;
  benefits: string[];

  isPublished: boolean;
  order: number;
  backgroundImage?: {
    url: string;
    source: "pexels" | "unsplash" | "custom";
    photographer?: string;
    photographerUrl?: string;
    alt: string;
  };
  animation?: {
    type: "fade" | "slide-up" | "slide-left" | "zoom" | "none";
    duration: number;

  };

## Best Practices

### Copywriting
- **Headlines**: Keep under 10 words, action-oriented
- **Subheadlines**: One clear sentence explaining the benefit
- **Benefits**: Short, punchy phrases (3-5 words each)
- **CTAs**: Use verbs ("Get", "Start", "Discover", "Take")

### Design
- **Images**: Choose high-quality, relevant images that support your message
- **Overlays**: Use dark overlays (50-70% opacity) for better text readability
- **Colors**: Maintain brand consistency with highlighted text

### Animation
- **Consistency**: Use the same animation type across all slides
- **Subtlety**: Faster isn't better - smooth transitions convert better
- **Mobile**: Test on mobile devices for performance

### Lead Generation
- **Urgency**: Use sparingly for maximum impact
- **Value**: Clearly communicate what users get
- **Friction**: Primary CTA should be low-friction (quiz, assessment)
- **Alternative**: Secondary CTA offers different path
